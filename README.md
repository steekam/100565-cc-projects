# Lab Assignments for ICS4211: Compiler Construction

## Table of Contents
- [Lab One](#lab-one)
- [Lab Two](#lab-two)

# Lab One
__Activity__: Designing a simple lexical analyzer

__Bonus__: Use Flex to automatically create the lexer

## Running the solution
The progam is in [SimpleLexer.cpp](Lab_One/SimpleLexer.cpp). It tokenizes sample code from [Program.txt](Lab_One/Pogram.txt).

You can run the already compiled executable file `SimpleLexer.exe`. The code was compiled on a Windows machine, if the executable errors, compile it using your system's C++ compiler, such as g++.

> Solution does not include Flex implementation of an automatic lexer.
